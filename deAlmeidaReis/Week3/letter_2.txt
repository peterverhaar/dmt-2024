February 17, 1933.Leonard Woolf, Esq.,52, Tavistock square,W.C.l.Dear Mr. Woolf,I have been waiting for information as to when the editor of “Good Housekeeping” would be returning from California, and have just ascertained that she will arrive, as at the present, arranged, at the beginning of March. Meanwhile, her assistant is asking – though naturally very tentatively – whether, should it not be possible to run the whole book in time, they might not be able to secure permission to publish the Biography in shortened form. Would Mrs. Woolf be likely to consent to such a course? There would be a strict understanding, of course in such event, that such cutting would only be done with Mrs. Woolf’s full approval at each point.Meanwhile, I should very much like to show the copy, if you agree, to the editor of “Woman’s Journal,” which is the only other magazine of similar size and scope to “Good Housekeeping”. The editor would, I know, give a quick reading, and with his decision in hand we should better know how to proceed when Miss Head returned. Meanwhile of course, it is quite clear to her staff that we cannot necessarily hold the matter up until her return.							Yours sincerely,						                (signature)
