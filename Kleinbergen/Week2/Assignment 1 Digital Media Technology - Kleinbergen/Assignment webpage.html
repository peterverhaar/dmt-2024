        <h3> My academic background as of today </h3>
        
        
     <p> I am a student at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en"> Leiden University, </a> where I completed my bachelors degree as well. I did a bachelor in medieval history. The topics I researched most was about Indonesia, because I am half-Javanese! 
         However, I found the topic to be too close to my own history, so I began to do my research on Ireland and the British colonization. The subject of my thesis was about insects, and how they were described in the Medieval encyclopedias.</p>
         
     <h3> My hobbies and talents </h3>
    
<p>

         In my free-time, you can find me on the stage. I am part of a student organization in Leiden, and last year I was secretary of the board there. I love to sing, act, draw, paint and write. I also like to read: I am currently into sci-fi horror books, but
         you can also find a lot of gothic literature on my bookshelf. I can really recommend the books by Harlan Ellison, like <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mefisto_in_Onyx"> Mefisto in Onyx </a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Have_No_Mouth,_and_I_Must_Scream"> I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream. </a>
        
        I also like video games. One game I can recommend is a game called <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/app/1205520/Pentiment/ > Pentiment </a>. It is about a man from the 15th century called Andreas Maler, who works as an artist at a scriptorium. Eventually, the story turns into a murder mystery. You learn a lot about Medieval German culture, christianity vs. paganism and book culture. I really enjoyed the game! </br>
        </br> 
       
        <h3> Languages </h3>
        
        <p>These are the languages I master: 
<ul> 
 <li>Dutch</li> 
 <li>English</li>
</ul>

I am currently trying to learn Gaelic on Duolingo, but I am a beginner. I also tried to learn Finnish, but I eventually stopped. I can say this in Finnish: <i> "Mina olen Michelle. Terve!" </i> Not very impressive, but a Finnish friend of mine is very impressed.
