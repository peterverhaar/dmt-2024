Dear Leonard,

The [lay] will do. Vive
Virginia, receive des entremetteuse.
As for dates, in next week. Its best
is Thursday 17th. Could she lunch with 
me in town, and so on after ?
Failing Thursday, Monday its 14th 
meeting me /in town/ at 11.30. I am
going to Crowborough I think 
from Monday to Thursday -- That
is why times are rather thight. I
suppose half a day is enough for 
Wembly it is [research state?]. My 
train from Granborough Thursday 
arrives 12.30 - Though if an earlier start is requested. If i 
might possibly arrange it, I suppose 
one guess is Wendly by [my time/tibe]. [It]
knows nothing. Any official pamphlets
are gratefully recieved.
Could you very kindly send Cavafy
