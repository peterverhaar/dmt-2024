Miss Barbara Hepworth, 
The Hogarth Press,
Pixmore Avenue, 
Letchworth, Herts.

Dear Miss Hepworth:
	We have your letter regarding the request from
House of Books, New York, for ten copies of your edition of
Woolf: A HAUNTED HOUSE, in which you say you assume that we
will have no objection to your supplying this small order. 
Naturally we should not wish to make any difficulty about so
small a matter, though it is true that if similar instances
were to be numerous, we should have to object to your supply-
ing in competition with us in the American market. As you
know, we have always consented to your sending over a pre-
publication supply of each of Mrs. Woolfâ€™s books, our of
consideration for the legitimate demand for the English first
edition. 
	However, there is a rather different point
involved in the case of supplying the English edition after
the book has been copyrighted in this country. Under the
copyright law, the importation of copies of the copyrighted
work for sale is illegal, and the Customs authorities are
required to refuse entry. As a matter of fact, the authorities
are not completely efficient about this, and copies do slip
through. The law does not permit even the publisher - that
is, the owner of the copyright - to import. We think you
should bear this aspect of the problem in mind in dealing
with orders you may receive for books that are copyrighted 
here.

Yours sincerely, 
Harcourt, Brace and Company,

Donald Brace.
