LETTER FROM EDWARD THOMPSON TO LEONARD WOOLF (01/01/1926)

SCAR TOP,

OXFORD.

Dear Mr. Woolf, 
		Yes, let Harcourt Bruce do an American edition, 
then. There are so many anti-British circles in the U.S.A., esp.
groups of Bengalis - Sudhindra Bose, Basanta Roy,& Co. - that other-
wise there will certainly be garbled part-printings of the book, 
esp. as it is so largely quotation.
		But I am not content to have it simply anti-
British propaganda, or to feed fat Yankee self-esteem. This Freface
has cost me a lot of bother, dissatisfied though it leaves me. But 
I shd. like it printed. One small thing that it does is, [it] save[s] the 
American copyright of the book, as printed by Harcourt Bruce. A 
bigger thing is, it will make a few folk see the way our Foreign 
Offices have through the Lionel Curtises & J.R. Motts collared the 
missions.

Yours sincerely 

[Edward Thompson]
