        <p>
           I am Cristina Vallesi and I am 34 years old. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I am an Italian woman who studied and obtained a Bachelor's degree in <b>Foreign Languages and Cultures</b> at the <a href= "https://www.unipg.it/"><i>University of Perugia</i></a>.<br/>Afterwards, I moved to Urbino and attended a Master's degree course in <b>Foreign Languages and Intercultural Studies (Publishing Translation and Language Education)</b> at the <a href= "https://www.uniurb.it/"><i>University of Urbino</i></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before starting the BDMS course at Leiden University, I worked as a substitute English teacher and as a bookstore assistant. Additionally, I worked in a print shop, and translated short novels in the meantime.
        </p>

        <p> Since my Bachelor's degree was focused on languages, here is the list of the languages that I master:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Italian</b> (mother tongue)</li>
            <li><b>English</b> (C1/C2)</li>
            <li><b>Spanish</b> (B2/C1)</li>
            <li><b>Japanese</b> (N5)</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>As for my technical skills, they are presented in the following table: 
        </p>

                <tr>
                <td><b>Expectations</b></td> <td>I would like to learn more about HTML.<br/>Moreover, since I am interested in working in the publishing sector,<br/>and considering that this field is evolving, I believe that<br/>learning how to create digital content could be useful.</td>
