    Modernism made an impact early in the 20th century. Artists such as the Frenchman <painter>Henri Matisse</painter>, the Norwegian <painter>Edvard Munch</painter> (whose 1893
    <painting>Scream</painting>
    summed up modern urban alienation) and the
    Austrian <painter>Oskar Kokoschka</painter> used vivid colours and broad brushstrokes to express mood and emotion, and the personal feelings evoked by a situation rather than the way it literally looked. Much avant-garde modernist culture – books such as James Joyce's
    <novel>Ulysses</novel>, poems such as T. S. Eliot's
    <poem>The Waste Land</poem>
    and Ezra Pound's
    <poem>Hugh Selwyn Mauberley</poem>, modern art, modern architecture, ballets staged by Sergei Diaghilev – was, for most of the first half of the 20th century, only enjoyed by small groups of intellectuals. The public reacted with jeers and contempt to Stravinsky’s
    <concert>The Rite of Spring</concert>, and D.H. Lawrence's
    <novel>
      Lady Chatterley's Lover</novel>
    has been banned in the UK for several decades. Whereas Pirandello's
    <play>Six Characters in Search of an Author</play>
    and Ionesco's
    <play>Rhinoceros</play>
    shaped the face of modernism in the theatre, their first stagings attracted extremely hostile public reactions.
