        <p>	<b>The Basics</b> <br/>
			My name is Zain, 26y/o, born and raised in The Hague. <br/>
			Due to the large number of international students living there, I'm often confused as one myself, but I am in fact a local from the notorious Schilderswijk. <br/>
			I completed my secondary education at Gymnasium Haganum, specializing in STEM, with little to no <i>genuine</i> interest in the exact sciences. <br/>
			As such I chose to flip the script and pursue a bachelor's degree in Japanese studies, which I finished right here at <a href="https://www.leiden.edu"> Leiden University</a> earlier this year, though truthfully, I've lost interest in Japan since covid.<br/>
			Academics aside, from the age of sixteen onward, I have been spending most of my mental effort into writing poetry and prose, honing my artistry through incessant practice and research, both personal and through the literary courses at Leiden. <br/>
            So simply put, the reason I've chosen the MA Book and Digital Media Studies is to brute force my way into the publishing world as an insider who is both author <i>and</i> agent. <br/>
			I'm not fussy about showing my work, feel free to ask me if you're interested.
