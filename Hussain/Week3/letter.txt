The letter from E. M. Foster to Leonard Woolf

8-7-24

Dear Leonard,

Can you deal with this preposterous yet touching letter? I funk it.
Tulloh (according to Firminger) was a Calcutta auctioneer whose portrait was painted by Zoffany as Judas Iscariot. 
There is probably a good deal to find out. 
The answer to the last paragraph is that 1817 and 1908 are the same, except for small variations in the text.

The letter from Donald Brace to Virginia Woolf

May 6, 1930.

Mrs. Virginia Woolf
52 Tavistock Square
London, W.C.1

Dear Mrs. Woolf:

I am enclosing three copies of the contract for the dramatic rights of ORLANDO, signed by Mrs. Metcalf, who is the person who plans to make the dramatization. James Whittaker, whose name appears in Clause 6, is to collaborate in the dramatization.

These agreements are along the lines of the proposed agreements submitted to me at the time I cabled you. As far as I know, the terms are the usual ones, and I believe the agreement is all right; at any rate, you are sure of $500, and it might turn out to mean a good deal more.

If you will send back two of the copies with your signature, they promise to pay the $500 upon delivery of the signed copies. I will arrange to have the Ann Watkins office send this to you direct (sic). You will see we are not appearing in this at all except, of course, in a friendly way whenever you wish us to.

With kind regards,
Yours sincerely,

DCB:CMc
Donald C Brace (signed in handwriting)
