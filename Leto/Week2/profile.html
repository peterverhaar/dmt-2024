    <p> Hi everyone! My name is Sara, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Italy. I got my bachelor's degree in Communcation and Media for Creative Industries at <a href="https://www.unipr.it"> University of Parma </a> with a literature oriented thesis based on the metafictional elements that can be found in Ian McEwan's Atonement and if and how those are transposed in its film adaptation. </br> </p>

    <p> I came here in The Netherlands to finish my studies because I always wanted to study in english and after a quite general and theoretical bachelor, this <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/media-studies/book-and-digital-media-studies"> MA </a> in Leiden felt like the best next choice. Since in this context my love for books is probably the least interesting thing about me, here's some random facts: </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li> I studied ballet, modern and contemporary dance for twelve years</li>
            <li> I've never broken a bone</li>
            <li> I once got lost at the Prado museum in Madrid</li>
            <li> I love rock music</li>
            <li> I can't sing</li>
            <li> My favourite place on earth is the beach</li>
        </ul>
     </p> 
     <h2> <b> Languages </b> </h2>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li> Italian (mothertongue)</li>
            <li> English (C1) </li>
            <li> Spanish (B1) </li>
            <li> French (A2) </li>
        </ul>

     </p>
     <h3> <b> Work Experience</b> </h3>
     <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 2023/2024: concert bus tour leader </li>
            <li> 2022/2023: art gallery assistant </li>
        </ul>
     </p>

            <td> <b>Prior knowledge</b></td> <td> During my bachelor I attended an informatics course of which a few theoretical notions may have stuck, but when it comes to digital and technological skills I consider myself quite an amateur. Microsoft word and powerpoint are fine, but open an excel sheet and you've lost me.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr style="width:20%">
            <td> <b>Expectations</b></td> <td> Considering the scope of this MA I have great expectations that in a year there is hope for my often illogical way of thinking to somehow acquire a more rational approach to things that are not necessarily words on paper. </td>
