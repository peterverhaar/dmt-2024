            Dear John,
                       Thanks very much for your letter.
The position at present is that M. Tavernier of "confluences" will, if he wishes to publish a translation of Journey to the Border, get in touch with you. In that case I ahould be glad if you would negotiate a contract. He hasn't yet seen the book, but the intending translation will be discussing it with him, and M. Tavernier will have made a decision bu the time he comes over here in the new year.
I am stil working at the new novel. I think that sometime woth while will come of it in the end.

Yours ever,
Edward.


H.P.
