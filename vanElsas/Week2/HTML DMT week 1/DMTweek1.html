        <p>My name is Eva van Elsas and I am 25 years old. I did my Bachelor's degree in <i>English Language and Culture</i> at <a href= "http://www.leiden.edu ">
        Leiden University</a>. I was born and (mostly) raised in the south of the Netherlands, except for a three year period where I lived in the USA.
        Therefore, I am fluent in both English and Dutch. I also had many years of language classes that unfortunately did not lead to mastery.
        </p>
        
        <p>These are the languages I can sort of speak:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>German</li>
            <li>French</li>
            <li> <b>(very little)</b> Greek</li>
        </ul>
         
        <table style="width:100%;"> 
            <tr>
                <td style="width:20%"><b>Prior Knowledge:</b></td> <td>Except for 1 class in computer science in high school, none</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="width:20%"><b> Expectations:</b></td> <td>The basics, including a little bit of coding, enough to hopefully help me in my future career </td>
            </tr>
