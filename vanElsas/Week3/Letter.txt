Dear Miss Lange,
Many thanks for your letter.
I enclose a few biographical details for 
the Book Society News. I have not a good photograph
of myself in my possession, but Howard
Coster has recently done a very good one. I
don’t know whether there is any possibility
that the Book Society might
be prepared to buy one from him: if not
please let me know and I will obtain one.
I have just received from John J.
Trounstine of New York an inquiry as
to whether any arrangements have been
made for publishing my book in America.
If no arrangements have been made, would

there be any objection to permitting him
to look for a publisher there?

Yours sincerely,
Edward Upward

Dear Mr Woolf,
Thank you very much
for your letter. I am glad that you would
like to publish The Border-Line.
I agree to the terms you suggest ?
a royalty of 15% on the first five thousand
copies sold and 20% after that, with an 
advance account of royalties of £20.
I am looking forward to meeting
you and Mrs Woolf on Thursday evening.

Yours sincerely,
Edward Upward
