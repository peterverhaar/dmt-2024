Dear Miss Belsher,
Would you be so kind as to let me know
the dates on which the amounts making up
advance royalties of £800 on All Passion Spent
were paid. I have only got two ammounts,
viz. £300 in May and £300 in November, and as
Mrs. Nicholson is away from Long Barn I have
no means of finding out, except through you, 
and I must know for Income Tax returns. I am
so sorry to worry you.

Yours sincerely,
Audrey Heffill
Secretary.
