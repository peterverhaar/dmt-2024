                Youtube video</a> of what was my faculty. I enrolled in the MA of <b> Media Studies: Book and Digital Media Studies </b> at <i>Leiden University</i> because working for an editorial or a publishing company is my dream job. I chose the Netherlands because I wanted to experience what is like living in this country.
    I currently live in <i>Den Haag</i> which is close to the city of <i>Leiden</i>. 
        </p>
       
        I am fluent in three different languages, which are:<ol> <li>Spanish </li> <li> English</li> <li> Valencian</li></ol> However, since I moved to the Netherlands I am trying to learn Dutch and hopefully I can manage to hold a conversation by the end of the school year.
        <p> I enjoy going on runs and sitting at a nice cafe enjoying the company of nice people. Regarding this course, this is what I can say: </p>

                        <td>I hope to gain a better understanding of HTML and XML usage. I am most looking forward to using Python, for the fact that I have heard of it many times in the past but I have never attempted to use it myself. Furthermore, I believe this course to be the perfect addition to my previous knowledge, and I am keen on learning about how these integrate and work within the editorial and publishing realm.</td>
