Homework for week 7- question 15-20 SQL

15- SELECT YEAR, COUNT(SOLD)
FROM BOOK
GROUP BY YEAR
HAVING COUNT(*)
But the correct answer was only, without "HAVING COUNT(*):
SELECT YEAR , COUNT(*)
FROM BOOK
GROUP BY YEAR


16- This one was incorrect, but the answer is 
SELECT DESCRIPTION, AVG(SOLD)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN GENRE
ON GENRE=GENRE_ID
GROUP BY DESCRIPTION

I did:
SELECT DESCRIPTION, AVG(SOLD)
FROM GENRE
LEFT JOIN BOOK
ON GENRE=DESCRIPTION

17-Also incorrect- I did:
SELECT AUTHOR, SUM(SOLD)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN AUTHOR
ON AUTHOR=AUTHOR_ID
GROUP BY AUTHOR

Correct answer was:
SELECT FIRST_NAME , LAST_NAME , SUM( SOLD )
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN AUTHOR
ON AUTHOR = AUTHOR_ID
GROUP BY AUTHOR

18- I did:
SELECT FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME,  COUNT(SOLD)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN AUTHOR
ON AUTHOR=AUTHOR_ID
But I forgot to add authors, not only one. It was incorrect too. This one I really missed a lot of commands.
Correct answer was:
SELECT AUTHOR, LAST_NAME , FIRST_NAME , COUNT(*)
FROM AUTHOR
LEFT JOIN BOOK
ON AUTHOR = AUTHOR_ID
GROUP BY AUTHOR
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

19- I did:
SELECT PUBLISHER, COUNT(*)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN PUBLISHER
ON PUBLISHER = PUBL_ID
GROUP BY PUBLISHER
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
But I did not get the names of the publishers in the table. It was incorrect too.
Correct answer was:
SELECT NAME , COUNT(*)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN PUBLISHER
ON PUBLISHER = PUBL_ID
GROUP BY NAME
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3

20- I did:
SELECT DESCRIPTION, MAX(SOLD)
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN GENRE
ON GENRE=GENRE_ID
GROUP BY DESCRIPTION
I used the correct answer from question 16 to help me out. But missed information again. The correct answer is:
SELECT DESCRIPTION, MAX(SOLD) AS 'HIGHEST_SALES'
FROM BOOK
LEFT JOIN GENRE
ON GENRE = GENRE_ID
GROUP BY DESCRIPTION
I did not know we can use "as" to give a new name to a column.
Note to myself: FROM...LEFT JOIN... ON... =... syntax gives more accurate, reliable results when combinig 2 tables than the use of "WHERE".
