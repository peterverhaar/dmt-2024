    In general:
    Where to add indentation? Both letters have clear indentations.

    Letter #1- Leonard Woolf to E. McKnight Kauffer
    
    a) the black ink of some of the letters (types) is "worn out" and there is no consistency in the letters which are faded. Is it important to mention
    that the letter contain types which are faded, but still legible? If it is, where to add this note? in the TEI header? In fact, need to crosscheck 
    if the house number is 14 or 141. 
    Found it - From E.McKnight's reply- his address is 141.
    I added "unclear" to line 112 of my TEI doc.


    Letter #2 - Donald C. Brace to Leonard Woolf about novel Orlando:

    a) The color of the ink the typewriter used was blue. Which element should I used and its attribute to mention that?
    b) a P.S. has to be characterised by the letters P.S? Or anything that is written after the signature can be considered P.S.? Even like a code? 
    c) At the top of the document there is the word "COPY [underlined]". Is that part of the body of the letter? Should I add an element before the Opener?
    Oh... "COPY" as it says at the top of the letter, is in blue, because the carbon copy paper used was blue? Is that it?
    d) Do I need to request a new identifier number for Mrs. Van Doren?  because I didn't find her name in Wikidata, nor in the list of all the existing local identifiers
