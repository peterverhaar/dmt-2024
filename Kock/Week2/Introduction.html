        <p class="header"><b>What have I studied so far?</b></p>
            <p> I did my bachelors degree in Mainz at the Johannes-Gutenberg-University: <a href= "https://www.uni-mainz.de/">click here to check it out</a>. My major was in Bookscience (Buchwissenschaften) and my minor was in English Literature and Culture. The program was mostly focused on historical aspects and was slightly lacking the modernity and tackling of current issues I am mostly interested in.
             </p>
        <br/>

        <p class="header"><b>Where have I worked?</b></p>
            <p> I have worked through most of my bachelors at a startup that focused on enhancing ebooks with media like images, video, sound etc. to create a modern and engaging new experience. I really enjoyed that kind of work, connecting old formats with new media and creating modernised entertainment based on the written word. I also have somewhat extensive experience in wrapping books as christmas presents as I have done that in book stores for multiple christmas seasons.</p>
        <br/>

<p class="header"><b>What languages do I speak?</b></p>
            <ul style="color:#260313">

        <li>English</li>
        <li>Dutch (a little)</li>
    </ul>
        <br/>

        <p class="header"><b>What am I interested in?</b></p>

    </ul>

        <p class="header"><b>Do I have prior coding experience?</b></p>
            <p> Technically, yes, kind of. But to be honest the context in which I learned HTML, php and a little bit of CSS was quite far removed from the book world and therefore I lost interest in coding after graduating high school as the topics had no immediate relevance for me outside of basic website upkeep.
                And my old University didn't really offer courses on it. So, in conclusion, it has been a while since I have used any coding language and I'm not sure how much of it I remember.</p>
        <br/>

        <p class="header"><b>What do I expect to learn in Media Studies?</b></p>
            <p> I hope to engage with and learn about coding and digital text management in a way that will be applicable in a work environment like a publishing house or book publishing in general. </p>
        <br/>

<p>So in short:</p>

        <table style="width: 100%; color:#260313">
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%">Prior Knowledge:</td> <td>Some prior experience, some while ago. HTML and php</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Expectations:</td> <td>Basic technical knowledge specifically for publishing and digital text management</td>
</tr>
</table>
