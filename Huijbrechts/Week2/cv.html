                I have obtained my BA in English Language and Culture from <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en">Leiden University</a> in 2023.
                <br><br>
                Due to my interest in Old English literature, I am currently pursuing the research master <i>Arts, Literature and Media</i> from Leiden University, specifically following the historical line of the programme. 
                As a current second-year student, I hope to complete my degree for this programme this academic year. 
                <br><br>
                I am also currently pursuing a second master's degree in this programme, <i>Media Studies: Book and Digital Media</i>, because I have some, although admittedly not a lot of, experience working with medieval manuscripts. 
                I also have also had an interest in digital media, ever since my computer science classes in secondary school and I even contemplated studying computer science, before settling on <i>English Language and Culture</i>.

                <p>
                    My current favorite novel is <i>A Day of Fallen Night</i> by Samantha Shannon, although I have reread its prequel <i>Priory of the Orange Tree</i> at least three times since its publication in 2019. <i>A Day of Fallen Night</i> even contains a quotation of <i>Wulf and Eadwacer</i>, a puzzling Old English text!
