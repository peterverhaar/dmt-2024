Dear Mr. Woolf:

		I am delighted to hear that the Book Society is
taking FLUSH as their October selection.	The changes in your
plans need not, I think, affect us at all. 	We were already
making a larger book than you were, and we shall go ahead with
Mrs. Bell's drawings as end papers and with the three photo-
graphs we already have.

		I note that your publication date will now be
October fifth.	We shall choose the same date un less something,
perhaps a book club choice here, should make a change necessary.
In any event, of course our date couldn't be before October
fifth.	The Book-of-the-Month Club is definitely interested,
but as three of their judges are in Europe, it will be some
little time before we shall have their final decision.

		I wish you would send me two copies of your edition
when you have it ready so that we may be in a position to us
them, if we need to, for copyrighting pusposes.

		We shall be glad to send you £20 as our fee for the
use of Mrs. Bell's end papers.

		Thank you for cabling so promptly the corrections
in respect to the dates in FLUSH.	I don't know whether he
Atlantic will have time to correct all of them or not, but
of course we are correcting them in he book.

		See enclosed letter from the Atlantic just received.

		With kind regards,

				Yours sincerely,
					Donald C. Brace.
