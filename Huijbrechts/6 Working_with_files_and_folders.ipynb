    "If you need to manage large numbers of files in a research project, it can be helpful to organise these files using folders and subfolders. To read the contents of such folders with multiple files, you can make use of the `os` library . The two letters in the name of this library stand for 'operating system'. The library includes various functions that can help you to work with files and folders. One useful function is `listdir()`, which, as is suggested by its name, gives you a list of all the files in a given directory. \n",

    "The `listdir()` function only provides the file names. If you want to do some actual work on files in the folder, you will in most cases need to the path to these files as well. In this example, the relative paths (i.e. the paths from the current location) to the files in the folder are relatively simple. The paths consist of the name of the folder, 'Corpus', combined with the file names.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The function `join()`, which is part of the `path` module of `os`, can be used to create a string representing the path to a certain file. If you have one variable which records the base directory of a file, and a second variable which captures the filename, the `join()` function can concatenate the values of these two variables to create the full path to this file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `join()` function always follows the conventions that are in place on a given operating system for representing paths. There can often be certain differences. While Mac OS uses forward slashes, for instance, Windows uses back slashes. Working with `join()` makes your code more platform-independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful function in `os` is `isfile()`. As you list the files in a certain directory, using `listdir()`, you can apply this function to check whether you are dealing with a file or with something else ( e.g. a subdirectory).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below offers a demonstration of these two functions. It lists all the files in the directory that is mentioned, and makes sure that all the subdirectories are ignored. Note that the first line imports the two functions that have been discussed above. As a result of this, it is no longer necessary to use the period syntax for `isfile()` and `join()`."

This first approach can be followed when units such as lines or paragraphs in the text are delineated using the hard return or the newline character.
