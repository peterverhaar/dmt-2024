Dear Mr. Wolfe,

Mrs. Spencer Curtis Brown is away from the office at
the ,oment so I am writing to you in her absence. We
have received an airmail from Mr. Ahmed Ali in which he 
says:

"Now that TWILIGHT IN DELHI has been included in
the list of books recommended to British soldiers
it should do very well indeed. This list, I find
will be distributed to all the British soldiers
in this country (India) or coming to it, and will 
become operative in another couple months. A
cheap edition therefore will be so much better and
an Indian edition, because easily available in this
country will be better still. I also discovered
that the novel won good points in a competition held
by two papers - the Illustrated Weekly of India and 
the Bombay Chronicle. It was within the first twenty
books on India - which included the classics and
philosophies and other books in a Best Bools com-
petition on India run by pearl Buok. TWILIGHT was 
within the first ten books. Two Indian publishers
have been asking me to give them permission to bring
out an edition immediately, of 3000 copies."

He is most anxious to have your permission for this
Indian edition to be brought out and I wonder, if, in the
circumstances, you would be willing to give your consent.

Yours very truly,
[unintelligible]
