Dear Mr. Rubio

A Room of one's Own by Virginia Woolf

You were formerly paying the royalties arising from the above work
to Mr. Leonard Woolf, the copyright owner at the time. However,
Mr. Woolf died in August 1969 and the Hogarth Press was then
appointed agent for all royalties arising from the works of Virginia 
Woolf.

I should be grateful therefore if you would accept this as authority,
and remit all outstanding royalties and future payments direct 
to the Hogarth Press on the due dates.

Yours sincerely,

B.A. Strange
Company Secretary
