AB			3rd February, 1950.


Dear Mrs. Lucas,

	I am extremely sorry that your 
letter of January 21 has not been
answered before.      Unfortunately,
however, Mr.Woolf has had to go into
a nursing home for an operation so
I have not been able to show him your
letter.     I am glad to say he is 
now making steady progress and I will
put your letter before him as soon as 
he is able to deal with correspondence.
It will probably be a month or so before
he is able to come into the office.

		Yours sincerely,

		for The Hogarth Press Ltd.

Mrs. E.B.C.Lucas,
Craston,
Yattendon, Newbury,
Berks.
