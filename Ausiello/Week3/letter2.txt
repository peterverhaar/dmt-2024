FR/US 4th Hune, 1952.

Dear Mr. Rosset,
Thank you for your letters of the 27th and 28th May. I was very intrested 
in your reflections on the Zodiac Books. We ourselves have Always found that
the Trollope titles proved the most oopular largely because our market, as yours,
is fairly well saturated with Jane Austen. I was very intrested too in your 
adverising piece. 

With regard to your second letter, there seems to be no objection to Handling
SADO in the States. I am not quite clear whether you would like to import bound
copies or our actual edition. We have plenty of sheets of this title and could
let you have what you required, but perhaps you could let me know whether you 
would like our edition bound, flat sheets, or a special edition for yourselves
with your own print on them.

The Stendhal and the Proust are, I am afraid, in the hands of American
publishers and we know before we start that it would be hopeless to get permission 
to import our editions. The Hayward anthologies are however available to the 
States and the same remarks apply to these as to SADO. I am sending sample copies 
of all three. If you would let me know the form in which you would like them, I 
can then quote you a price. 

I am sending you two complete sets of Proust and the handbooks although we 
are not supposed to send these books to American, but as I presume they are for 
your personal use, I do not think the American publishers will mind.

Yours sincerely,
Barney Rosset, Eaq.,
