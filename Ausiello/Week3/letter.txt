AB 16th Februay, 1954.

Dear Sirs,

In reply to your request, dated 
February 4, to record ORLANDO for the 
use of the blind, I am sorry to see 
that you say that this is your third 
request. Your previous letter was 
passed to Mr. Leonard Woold, as he deals 
with requests for Mrs. Woolf's books, 
and I understood from him that he had 
written giving his permission, but saying
that you must also obtain permission
from the American publishers, Kessers,
Harcourt Brace of 383 Madison Avenue, 
New York. 

Yours faithfully,


for The Hogarth Press Ltd.

The Executive Director,
The National Committee for Recording for the 
Blind Inc.,
26 West Forty-Fourth Street,
New York 26, N.Y.
