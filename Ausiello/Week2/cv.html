<h3>About me</h3>
<p>
Hello! I am Chiara and I come from Naples, Italy. <br>
Literature has always been my greatest passion, therefore I have decided to specialise in literary investigation since I was in high school. <br>
I have studies foreign languages, linguistics and literatures in high school and during my bachelor, studying German, Spanish and English, as you can see below. <br>
For my first Master of Arts, I decided to continue my literary theoretical inveatigations, doing a in comparative literature, in Utrecht. <br>
However, since I was very young, my goal is to work as an editor in a publishing house. For this reason, I decided to start this new Master at Leiden University. <br> 
I am sure it is going to be amazing! </p>
