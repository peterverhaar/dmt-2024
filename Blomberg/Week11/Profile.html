        <h2>Welcome to my introduction page!</h2>
       <p>My name is Julia Blomberg. I am a Dutch student at the University of Leiden. My bachelor's degree was English Language and Culture at <a href="https://www.uva.nl/en">the Universtity of Amsterdam</a> Which was a program that focussed
           on English Literature and Linguistics.I specialised in Medieval English and did my minor in Linguistics. So it will come as no surprise that I have very little experience with digital technology, so the course <i>Digital Media Technology</i> will 
           be a challenge. However, this does mean there is a lot of new things for me to learn, which is exciting</p> 
       
        <h3>A little about myself</h3>
        <p> I just turned 26 in August. My hobbies include reading, knitting, gaming, playing Dungeons and Dragons with my friends. I also really enjoy my job. I work at the outdoor history museum Archeon, where I work as a "professional Roman". As you can see in the picture, where i am posing with my nephew, 
        this means I dress up in historical attire and show our visitors how Romans lived in the Netherlands almost 2000 years ago. I get to work with children and adults and just explain history to them.
        I love history, so this is great fun.</p>
        <p> As a former English Literature major, I feel like i should include some reading recommendations (don't worry, they won't be too pretentious). </p>
       
     <p> This is a list of random books I would recommend:
	<ul>
		<li> <i> The Night Circus </i> by <a href="https://erinmorgenstern.com/">Erin Morgenstern</a> </li>
		<li> <i> The Starless Sea </i> By Erin Morgenstern </li>
		<li> <i> The Midnight Library </i> By <a href="https://www.matthaig.com/">Matt Haig</a> </li>
		<li> <i> Babel </i> by <a href="https://rfkuang.com/">R.F. Kuang</a> </li>
		<li> <i> The Trial </i> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Kafka">Franz Kafka</a> </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    <p> As someone who is interested in languages, people often ask me how many languages I actually speak. Unfortunately, the answer is always a bit disappointing 
	<ul>
		<li> Dutch (native language) </li>
		<li> English (but who doesn't) </li>
		<li> German (very badly) </li>
		<li> French (even worse) </li>
	</ul>
	</p>
    <p> As for my prior knowledge and expectations: </p>

<table style="width: 100%">
<tr>
<td style="width: 20%">Prior knowledge </td> <td> Absolutely no prior knowledge. Computers are not really my fort√©.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Expectations</td> <td> Since there is no prior knowledge, I expect to learn a lot of new thing, develop useful skills and maybe discover a new passion.</td></tr>
</table>

	<p> Thank you for reading my introduction. I hope you enjoyed it and got to know me a little bit better. </p>
