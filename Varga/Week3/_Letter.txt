My dear Leonard, 


I am enclosing two very rough “roughs” to your cover design. A design is based on the (mark?) enclosed. 


Perhaps these are too vulgar, perhaps too restricted in symbolism. I think however, that they should not be too tentative in suggestion but bold and different. I can do a photo montage if you prefer it. But these roughs strike me as being different and to the point. 
If you decide, I can finish the design in a day or two. 


All my best wishes,
Sincerely ____ 
E McKnight Kauffer

Letter from William Plomer to Leonard Woolf

My dear Leonard, 
 Thank you for your letter of yesterday. I should be happy to see some book of mine in the New Phoenix Library and would agree to the terms you propose, but would you consider reissuing Sado instead of I Speak for Africa? I don’t feel that anything in I Speak for Africa is worth reproducing except “Ula Masondo” and a much shorter story called “Black Peril” . I should like to think that Sado is worth reviving for readers of a new generation who have never heard it. 


With love from William.


I wish you would put “The Village in the Jungle” in the New Phoenix Library
