        <h1>Hiya, Welcome to my page!</h1>
        
        <p>To briefly introduce myself:<br/></p>
        <p>My name is Nikki van Balkom, I am a 21 year old student from the Netherlands. Most particularly from the lovely Noord-Brabant province.<br/>
            The most obvious reason as to why I chose to study BDMS is mainly because I love <b>LOVE </b>books.</p>
        <p>To choose a favourite book is like choosing a favourate child...<i>,impossible and should not be done:)<br/>
        </i>however I would always say that Throne of Glass, as unoriginal it may be, will always hold a special place in my heart</p>
        <h2>Previous experience and undergraduate</h2>
        <p>I have no prior experiences with studying in this particular field.<br/>
            I did my bachelors at Maastricht University and I got my BSc in Global Studies.<br/>
            <a href="https://curriculum.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/bachelor-global-studies">My undergraduate study</a></p>
     
        <p>The languages that I master:
        <ul> 
            <li>Dutch</li> 
            <li>English</li>
            <li>A bit of Spanish and Mandarin</li> 
            <li>Some knowledge of Python</li>
        </ul>
        <table style="width: 100%;"> 
            <tr> 
                <td style="width: 20%;"><b>Prior Knowledge</b></td> <td><i>I do not have any HTML experience but I do have some general experience with Python</i></td>
            </tr> 
            <tr> 
                <td><b>Expectations</b></td> <td><i>My expectations for this DMT course are to refresh any prior knowledge on Python, but mainly to learn new stuff such as HTML and text mining.</i> </td>
            </tr>
