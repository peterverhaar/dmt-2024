Dear Miss Hepworth,

	Thank you for sending back the postal order. I am sorry I misunderstood the account you sent me. 
I am sending my copy of the Crown edition of Journey to The Border to LÃ©on Perrin of Avignon who is thinking of translating it for 'Confluences'. He want to know details about copyright. I should be glad if you could let me have these and also if you would let me know whether I have the permission of the Hogarth Press to tell him to go ahead with the translation if he wishes to do so. His son whom I have met in London is returning to France next Thursday Dec 20th and I should like to have the necessary information before then.

Yours sincerely,

Edward Upward.

Letter from Edward Upward to Leanard Woolf 17/11/1937

Dear Mr Woolf,

	I am sorry for my delay in answering your last letter. I have been trying to think of another title for the Borderline and I have not yet discovered anything really satisfactory. The best I can suggest is 'Journey to The Border', or if that is too near to the Original title perhaps 'Descent from the Race course' would do - though I don't very much like it.
	I have not had a free evening for some time and have not yet made the necessary corrections in the typescript, but I will do so to-morrow and will post the typescript on Friday.
	Yours sincerely,
		Edward Upward
