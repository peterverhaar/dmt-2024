1.	Create a full list of all the countries which have participated in the PISA survey of 2022. 
SELECT DISTINCT country_code, country_name
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code

2.	What was the OECD average in 2022? 
SELECT AVG(reading_total)
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code
WHERE year = 2022

3.	What were the OECD averages per continent in 2022? [Tip: group the scores by continent and calculate the average scores for each continent.] 

SELECT AVG(reading_total)
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code
WHERE year = 2022
GROUP BY continent

4.	For the various surveys that have been conducted over the years, create a list of all the OECD averages. Has there been a general increase or a decline? Show these averages in a bar chart as well. 

SELECT year, AVG(reading_total)
SELECT year, AVG(reading_total)
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year

5.	How have the PISA scores for reading skills developed chronologically for students in the Netherlands? 

SELECT year, reading_total
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code
WHERE country_name = 'Netherlands'
ORDER BY year

6.	Make a list of all the reading scores obtained in Europe in 2018. Which European country had the highest scores for reading in 2018? Which country had the lowest score? 

SELECT country_name, reading_total
FROM performance
LEFT JOIN oecd_country
ON country = country_code
WHERE continent = 'Europe'
AND year = 2018
AND reading_total IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY reading_total DESC
