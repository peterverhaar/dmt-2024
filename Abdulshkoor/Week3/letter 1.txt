Letter from Aline Burch to Penguin Books (08/07/1948)

AB
8th July, 1948.

H. Summers, Esq.,
Penguin Books Ltd.,
West Drayton, Middx.

Dear Sir,

Mr. Woolf has asked me to reply
to your letter to him of June 30,
and to explain the position with
regard to THE COMMON READER, Series
I and II. We, ourselves, have just
been able to reprint the First Series
in our Uniform Edition at 7/6d. and
the Second Series is at the binders,
and Mr. Woolf feels that the issue of
a 1/6d Penguin reprint, at the same
time, cannot fail to have an adverse
affect on the sales of the Uniform
Edition. In the circumstances, there-
fore, he would very much prefer not
to renew the Penguin contracts,
at any rate for the present.

Yours faithfully,

Secretary to Mr. Woolf
