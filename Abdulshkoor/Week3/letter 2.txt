Letter from Aline Burch to Liveright Publishing Corporation (12/05/1949)

AB
12th May, 1949.

Dear Sir,

Group Psychology and the Analysis
of the Ego: Sigmund Freud

Thank you for your letter of May 2.
We are putting in hand at once your order
for 2600/2500 folded and collated sheets
of the above book. AS these sheets are
not being printed by the same firm as
THE FUTURE OF AN ILLUSION, I wonder if
you could let us have another stereo of
your collophon?

With regard to the price, we have
gone into the figures again, and although
this is cutting things very fine for us,
we feel that we should like to meet you
in this particular instance. We will,
therefore, invoice the sheets to you at
2s.2d. instead of 2s.4d. as previously
quoted.

Yours truly,

for The Hogarth Press Ltd.
