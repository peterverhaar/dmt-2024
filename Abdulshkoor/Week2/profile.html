        <h2><i>Hello / Hallo / Ahlan!</i></h2>
        
        <p><b>Hello, I'm Layan Abdul Shakoor.</b> My first name is pronounced exactly as you'd say "Leanne", and my mother chose this name because it has both Arabic and Western meanings.</p>

            <img src="me.jpeg" width = "300"/>
        
        <p>I am a Saudi-Austrian publisher and aspiring book historian. I have recently moved to the Netherlands with my beloved two dogs, who are rescues from a Jeddah-based dog shelter.</p>
       
        <p>I studied <b><a href="https://www.northwestern.edu/">Media and Filmmaking at Northwestern University</a></b> and graduated as valedictorian of my class back in the day.</p>
       
        <p>As a publisher with more than 8 years of experience in the field, <b>I founded <b><a href="https://www.instagram.com/mauzoun/">Mauzoun</a></b>, the Arab world's first exclusively royalty-based publishing house</b>,
        and we won several awards for our work. We publish Arabic language novels, graphic novels, and coffee table books.</p>

            <p><i>One of our most popular publications.</i></p>
       
        <h3><b>I speak the following languages:</h3></b>
            <ul>
                <li>Arabic</li>
                <li>English</li>
                <li>German (rather terribly but it's good enough to enjoy German soap operas with my grandmother.)</li>
                <li>Ik probeer Nederlands te leren en ik spreek en beetje van (did I get that right?)</li>
            </ul>
