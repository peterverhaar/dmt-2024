    Modernism made an impact early in the 20th century century. Artists such as the Frenchman Henri Matisse, the Norwegian Edvard Munch (whose 1893
    <title genre="paintings">Scream</title>
    summed up modern urban alienation) and the
    <title genre="novels"> Austrian Oskar Kokoschka </title>used vivid colours and broad brushstrokes to express mood and emotion, and the personal feelings evoked by a situation rather than the way it literally looked. Much avant-garde modernist culture – books such as James Joyce's
    <title genre="novels">Ulysses</title>, poems such as T. S. Eliot's
    <title genre="poems">The Waste Land</title>
    and Ezra Pound's
    <title genre="poems">Ulysses</title>, modern art, modern architecture, ballets staged by Sergei Diaghilev – was, for most of the first half of the 20th century, only enjoyed by small groups of intellectuals. The public reacted with jeers and contempt to Stravinsky’s
    <title genre="plays">The Rite of Spring</title>, and D.H. Lawrence's
    <title genre="novels">
      Lady Chatterley's Lover</title>
    has been banned in the UK for several decades. Whereas Pirandello's
    <title genre="plays">Six Characters in Search of an Author</title>
    and Ionesco's
    <title genre="plays">Rhinoceros</title>
    shaped the face of modernism in the theatre, their first stagings attracted extremely hostile public reactions.
