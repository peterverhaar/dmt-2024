Dear Mr. Woolf:

A new tax law has just been passed by Congress
under which we shall be required after July second to with-
hold for income tax 10% on all payments of royalty to non-
resident aliens instead of the current rate of 4%. According
to the contract for Mrs. Woolf's new novel, we shall be paying
an advance of $1000 on publication, but in order to take
advantage of the old rate, I am sending now a check for $1920,
representing a payment of $2000 as a general advance, less 
$80 for the tax at the current 4%. You may as well
have the advantage of this saving.

It is some time since you wrote that Mrs. Woolf
had become tired out by her work on the novel and had had to
put aside the proofs. I hope she has recovered long before
this, but I should greatly appreciate it if you would let me
have some word.
With kindest regards,
Yours sincerely,
Donald Brace.
DCB: CMc.
