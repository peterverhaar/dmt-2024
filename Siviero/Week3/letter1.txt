Dear Mr. Woolf,
Thanks for your letter. The religious people
ought to bother about the matter, for every reason. Lofthouse & 
Beales have already said they will do all they can - & Lofthouse
counts for a lot, as he should do. Streeter & Seibie I will see
when I go back to Oxford. I dont think it worth while wasting a 
single review-copy on a religious paper, direct.
Sasson, Graves, Forster are interested in
the matter, as you know; but they are all more in touch with you
than with me. H.M. Tomilnson will certainly be interested, if he
happens to be in the Westmr.office when the book comes in.
The Theosophists I dont know; but Mrs.
Ransom, Letchworth, Herts, seems to run their English lit-
erary side, and she used to - probably still does - edit a paper 
India ( or New India- I forget the title). They have a v. aggress-
ive colony at Letchmorth. Cousins, the Irish poet, & esp. his wife
Margaret Cousins, still runs their Indian work at Adyar, Madras, I
believe. [hand written] I have met them, fore years ago, at Tajore's school, Santiniketan. Mrs.
Cousins writes a lot on Indian matters. []
There is nothing to answer in this note.
Yours sincerely
[hand written] Edward Thompson
Clement Shorter j the Sphere is v. friendly towards me
personally; but I have no notion what his political views are - probably
strongly tory. The same remarks hold j Adcock, j the Bookman. []
